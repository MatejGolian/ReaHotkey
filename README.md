# What's This And Who Is It For?
This is a collection of AutoHotkey scripths I wrote in order to make certain virtual instruments/sample libraries  and related programs at least a little more accessible to blind users. These scripts are based on my [accessibilityOverlay](https://github.com/MatejGolian/accessibilityOverlay) script and are primarily designed to run in tandem with the REAPER digital audio workstation, although in particular cases standalone versions may be supported as well.
## Scripts And Features
* Areia/Jaeger Mix Selector - Makes it possible to switch between the classic and modern mixes in Audio Imperia's Areia and Jaeger libraries.
  - Only works inside REAPER.
* Nucleus Mix Selector - Makes it possible to switch between the classic and modern mixes in Audio Imperia's Nucleus library.
  - Only works inside REAPER.
* Shreddage Guitar Selector - Makes it possible to activate/deactivate multitracked guitars/basses in Impact Soundworks Shreddage-series instruments.
  - Only works inside REAPER.
* Engine Access - Makes it possible to load instruments and add libraries in Best Service Engine 2.
  - Works both inside REAPER and in the standalone version of Engine 2.
* HotspotHelper - A special utility to make developing these kind of scripts a little easier.
  - Retrieves window and control classes and creates labelled hotspots that can be exported to clipboard for subsequent use.
