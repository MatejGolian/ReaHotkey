# What's This And Who Is It For?
This is an AutoHotkey scripth I wrote in order to make certain virtual instruments/sample libraries  and related programs at least a little more accessible to blind users. It is based on my [accessibilityOverlay](https://github.com/MatejGolian/accessibilityOverlay/) script and is primarily designed to run in tandem with the REAPER digital audio workstation, although in particular cases standalone versions of programs/instruments may be supported as well.
## Features
* Makes it possible to switch between the classic and modern mixes in Audio Imperia's Areia and Jaeger libraries.
  - Only works inside REAPER.
* Makes it possible to switch between the classic and modern mixes in Audio Imperia's Nucleus library.
  - Only works inside REAPER.
* Makes it possible to activate/deactivate multitracked guitars/basses in Impact Soundworks Shreddage-series instruments.
  - Only works inside REAPER.
* Makes it possible to load instruments and add libraries in Best Service Engine 2.
  - Works both inside REAPER and in the standalone version of Engine 2.
## About HotspotHelper
HotspotHelper is a special utility to make developing these kind of scripts a little easier. It retrieves window and control info and creates labelled hotspots that can be copied to clipboard for subsequent use.
