# What's This And Who Is It For?
This is a collection of AutoHotkey scripths I wrote in order to make certain virtual instruments/sample libraries  and related programs at least a little more accessible to blind users. These scripts are based on my [accessibilityOverlay](https://github.com/MatejGolian/accessibilityOverlay) script and are primarily designed to run in tandem with the REAPER digital audio workstation, although in certain cases standalone versions may be supported as well.
## Scripts And Features
* Areia/Jaeger Mix Selector - Makes it possible to switch between the classic and modern mixes in Audio Imperia's Areia and Jaeger libraries
  - only works inside REAPER
* Nucleus Mix Selector - Makes it possible to switch between the classic and modern mixes in Audio Imperia's Nucleus library
  - only works inside REAPER
* Shreddage Guitar Selector - Makes it possible to activate/deactivate multitracked guitars/basses in Impact Soundworks Shreddage-series instruments
  - only works inside REAPER
* Engine Access - Makes it possible to add libraries in Best Service Engine 2
  - works both inside REAPER and in the standalone version of Engine 2
